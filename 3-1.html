    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><code><pre>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.<br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.<br>It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.<br>The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.<br>Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully,<br>and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.</pre></code></p>
